Now is possible to add a player into your friendslist!
With this feature I've did another correlated feature, Notification System.

### Friends System
+ "Add friend" button into the userpage that if clicked will add/remove the player to/from your friendslist.

### Notifications System
Now you can receive and read notifications!
+ "Bell" icon besides the account username into the navbar.
+ Possibility to see the notifications clicking the bell.
+ Once clicking the bell, the system will detect that you have seen the notifications and the next time you'll not have any un-readed notification.
